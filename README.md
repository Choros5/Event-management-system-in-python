**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
This project is a comprehensive Event Management System developed using Flask and MySQL, designed to facilitate seamless event registration and management. The system encompasses various functionalities to cater to both participants and administrators.

Key Features:
Event Registration Portal:

Participant Registration: Users can register for events by providing their personal details such as name, mobile number, email, and selecting the event they wish to participate in.
Validation: Ensures the correctness of user inputs like mobile number length and email format. It also checks for duplicate registrations and event capacity limits.
Admin Dashboard:

Login Authentication: Admins can log in using their credentials to access the event management dashboard.
Event Management: Admins can create new events by specifying details such as event name, fee, maximum participants, type, location, and date.
Event Deletion: Admins have the ability to delete events if necessary.
Event Information and Participant List:

Event Overview: Displays detailed information about each event, including the number of participants registered.
Participant List: Admins can view a list of participants for each event, displaying their full names, mobile numbers, and email addresses.
Database Interaction:

MySQL Integration: The system interacts with a MySQL database to store and retrieve event and participant data.
Dynamic Queries: Custom queries are executed to manage data efficiently and ensure real-time updates.
Technical Details:
Backend: Flask, a micro web framework in Python, handles the web server and routing.
Database: MySQL is used for storing event details, participant information, and administrative data.
Frontend: HTML templates rendered by Flask provide a user-friendly interface for participants and administrators.
How It Works:
Home Page: Users are presented with a registration form to sign up for events.
Admin Page: Administrators can log in to manage events and view participants.
Event Type Management: Admins can add or delete event types and view statistics on participant counts.
Participant Management: A dedicated section for viewing and managing registered participants.
This Event Management System streamlines the process of event organization and participant registration, making it an ideal solution for institutions and organizations looking to efficiently manage their events.
